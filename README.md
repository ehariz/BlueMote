# BlueMote
An Android app to control your computer from your phone, using bluetooth. 
Based on google's android bluetoothchat sample, available here : https://github.com/googlesamples/android-BluetoothChat

BlueMote includes a server app to run on your computer, and an Android App to control your computer from your phone. The server
app uses the Bluecove API to read incoming bluetooth data. 
The Android app, for now, allows you to switch windows on your computer, move the mouse and click from your phone.
